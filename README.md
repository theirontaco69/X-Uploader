i was trying to make a chrome extension to help with uploading on x.com (twitter)
kinda hit as far as i can with it, and it was suggested to me to upload it here :)


when you schedule posts on x.com it sucks to have to fill out the full date each time. 
the idea with X-Uploader is 
- to help with this process for those who upload images bulk  
- set up a schedule to post every hour. 
- have an input field where you put the start date/time.
- be able to drag as many photos as i wanted into it and then have it auto schedule every hour (+/- every 5 mins)


i got as far as i could with the help of chatgpt lol
it works to upload the photos and when you press schedule posts it gives a signal in the dev tools.  
the UI a bit messed up, the schedule button should be at bottom 

but i think you may need a x.com dev account and api access to get it to work. i wanted it to be more like a macro recorder but i guess its not that easy lol
